## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Help from a youtube video

### What I learned

This the first (kinda) Frontend Mentor project I've ever completed! I am a noob at HTML and CSS so I learned a lot doing this even though it was a simple challenge. I learned about the

```html
<picture> </picture>
```

tag in html! It's was very useful for switching the images depending on screen width. I learned a lot about CSS basics like layout, grid, flex-box, font sizing, hover and focus states etc.

### Continued development

There is a lot I need to learn. In particular, I still find mobile-first and responsive design to be a bit tricky. I think I need to practice it more and get a more firm grasp of layout in CSS before it becomes comfortable for me. Also, I tried to use BEM in this challenge but tbh, I barely understand what it is and what the purpose of it is. I'm going to study that later.

### Useful resources

- [This youtube video by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - Kevin Powell's video doing this challenge. Very helpful video I watched to get some ideas and I used when I got stuck. I tried to not just copy what he did though.
  He is a guru and a very Positive Mental Attitude gentlemen. Anything I know about CSS at this point is from either the MDN docs or him.
